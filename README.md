# Styled Components

### Summary

Today we were introduced to [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) which allows you to essentially write CSS directly within the component you are styling instead of utilizing a global .css file. I think this makes sense and allows you to focus on all aspects of the component in one file.

We use these styled-components in the styled-user-cards folder where we are hitting the https://randomuser.me/ api to receive random user information in JSON and rendering that.


The react-metronome folder was a pair programming assignment where I teamed up with Kyra to follow the metronome tutorial on [Dave Ceddia's Blog](https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/).
